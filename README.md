### Benefits
* **Fast and Scalable:** You can easily scale the SonarCloud as the size of the project grows. No hassels for the user since it is entirely on the cloud and it automatically handles scalability.  
* **Thousands of rules:** Thanks to powerful static code analyzers, you can monitor an array of rules and can easily track down bugs and other quality issues easily.
* **Deep code analysis:** SonarCloud can explore all your source files, whether in branches or pull requests, to reach a green quality gate and promote the build. This makes it really handy to use in huge teams where each team commits to a separate branch, so that the code can be properly analyzed before it can be merged into the master branch.
* **Cloud CI Integrations:** Execution of an analysis can be easily scheduled from Cloud CI tools like Travis, Jenkins and AppVeyor.  
* **Support for 16 languages:** It supports a variety of languages like Java, JS, C#, C/C++, Objective-C, TypeScript, Python, ABAP, PLSQL, T-SQL etc, so it is pretty flexible and can be appied over an array of projects.
